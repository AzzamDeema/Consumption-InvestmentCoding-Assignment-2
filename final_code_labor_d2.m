%Explain what you would qualitatively expect would occur to the standard 
% deviation of n in the following cases.
 
%(a) The borrowing constraint were zero.
% Borrowing contraint being zero means that household would not be able to borrow assets.
% This would force households to adjust labor when their income stream is
% low, working more. Their labor would thus follow variations in the income
% stream, increasing the stabndard deviation of n labor hours (supply).

%(b) The relative risk aversion parameter doubled.
% Households become more risk averse and will adjust their labor supply,
% working more to smooth consumption. As such, standard deviation of labor
% hours increases as consumers adjust labor frequently to match with income
% volitility.

%(c) The Frisch labor supply elasticity doubled.
% Households become more willing to provide labor given chnages in wage. As
% such, labor supply becomes more sensitive and reactive, increasing
% standard deviation of n.

%(d) Real wage volatility doubled.
% As real wage volitility increases, households will provide more labor to smooth
% consumption. Labour supply tracks income therefor as real wage volitility
% rises, standard deviation of n rises as well.
